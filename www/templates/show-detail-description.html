    When former government agent and fugitive Raymond "Red" Reddington surrenders to the FBI, he makes them an offer
    they can't refuse. On the mysterious condition that he work only with recent Quantico graduate Liz Keen, he
    agrees
    to help put away criminals from a list that he compiled, which includespoliticians, mobsters, spies and
    international terrorists -- starting with long-thought-dead terrorist Ranko Zamani. As the two pursue their
    quarry, Red forces the rookie profiler to think like a criminal to see the bigger picture.
